Python SWIG wrapper for Niflib

To use:  Unzip the files to your Python folder (Probably C:\Python24).

Due to the many API changes in this version of Niflib, the module is called "new_niflib" to
give people using the existing Niflib for Python the ability to use both versions at the same time.
The next major release will return to the name "niflib."

From within Python:

import new_niflib

or

from new_niflib import *
